# Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting

This repository contains code and data for analyzing the USD - INR conversion rate over the years. The analysis includes data visualization, growth analysis, seasonal decomposition, and time series forecasting using SARIMA.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, pmdarima

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Currency-Exchange-Rate-Forecasting.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Currency-Exhange-Rate-Forecasting
   ```
   
3. Install the required libraries

   ```bash
   pip install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, statsmodels, pmdarima
   ```

## Usage
Download the data file **INR-USD.csv** and place it in the project directory.

Run the Currenyc **Exchange Rate Forecasting.ipynb** notebook to perform the analysis. Make sure to update the file paths if necessary.

The notebook will generate various plots and visualizations, including the conversion rate over the years, yearly growth, monthly growth, and time series forecasting.

The final output will be displayed in the notebook and saved as interactive HTML files for easy sharing.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the historical USD - INR conversion rate, including trends, growth patterns, and future predictions. The results can help understand the currency exchange dynamics and make informed decisions.
